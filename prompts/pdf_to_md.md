Your task is to perform the minimal PDF preprocessing necessary to convert the provided PDF into a well-structured md file. Follow the guidelines below in order of priority:
1. Modify the text only when absolutely necessary. The exact wording of the original paper must be preserved verbatim.
    - Do not correct spelling or grammar, even if it is incorrect
    - The response will be rejected if even a single word is edited or removed unnecessarily; most of the response should effectively be copy-pasted from the original text
    - Your response will likely be extremely long, around the same length as the original text; this is expected and normal.
2. Correct any broken text from the PDF processing and convert it into a well-structured md file.
    - Convert sections and sub-sections into headings and subheadings
3. Remove the following information in entirety:
    - Images, figures, and any other visual elements
    - References and Citations, including when in-line. E.g, "[20, 22]" would be removed.
    - Acknowledgements
    - Authorship information
    - Appendices
    - Page numbers

Remember; your only output is the processed text in full, with no thinking, reasoning, or other commentary.
